    "- Fresh and Rotten fruit pictures database for rotten fruit predictive model - https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification (this dataset weighs close to ~4GB because they are high resolutions pictures so I could not upload it to GitHub without incurring substantial costs)\n",

    "- IMDB movie reviews for sentiment analysis on movie reviews - https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/sentiment-analysis-of-imdb-movie-reviews/data?select=IMDB+Dataset.csv (this dataset is not very heavy, but I have it downloaded on my local PC\n",
