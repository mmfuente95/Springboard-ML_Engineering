7,"and perseverance, proven character; and proven character, hope;",ROM-4-4
9,"and hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out within our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.",ROM-4-5
11,"For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.",ROM-4-6
13,For one will hardly die for a righteous man; though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.,ROM-4-7
15,"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.",ROM-4-8
17,"Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him.",ROM-4-9
19,"For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.",ROM-4-10
21,"And not only this, but we also exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received the reconciliation.",ROM-4-11
23,"Therefore, just as through one man sin entered into the world, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all sinned--",ROM-4-12
25,"for until the Law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.",ROM-4-13
27,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam until Moses, even over those who had not sinned in the likeness of the offense of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.",ROM-4-14
29,"But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one the many died, much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abound to the many.",ROM-4-15
31,"The gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned; for on the one hand the judgment arose from one transgression resulting in condemnation, but on the other hand the free gift arose from many transgressions resulting in justification.",ROM-4-16
33,"For if by the transgression of the one, death reigned through the one, much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.",ROM-4-17
35,"So then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men.",ROM-4-18
37,"For as through the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, even so through the obedience of the One the many will be made righteous.",ROM-4-19
39,"The Law came in so that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,",ROM-4-20

5,Or do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?,ROM-5-3

9,"For if we have become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be in the likeness of His resurrection,",ROM-5-5
11,"knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with, so that we would no longer be slaves to sin;",ROM-5-6
13,for he who has died is freed from sin.,ROM-5-7
15,"Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with Him,",ROM-5-8
17,"knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, is never to die again; death no longer is master over Him.",ROM-5-9

41,Therefore what benefit were you then deriving from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the outcome of those things is death.,ROM-5-21
43,"But now having been freed from sin and enslaved to God, you derive your benefit, resulting in sanctification, and the outcome, eternal life.",ROM-5-22

7,"Therefore, my brethren, you also were made to die to the Law through the body of Christ, so that you might be joined to another, to Him who was raised from the dead, in order that we might bear fruit for God.",ROM-6-4

15,"But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me coveting of every kind; for apart from the Law sin is dead.",ROM-6-8

19,"and this commandment, which was to result in life, proved to result in death for me;",ROM-6-10

23,"So then, the Law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.",ROM-6-12

27,"For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.",HEB-6-14
29,"And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek,",HEB-6-15
31,"who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life.",HEB-6-16
33,"For it is attested of Him, ``YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF MELCHIZEDEK.""",HEB-6-17
35,"For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness",HEB-6-18
37,"(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.",HEB-6-19
39,And inasmuch as it was not without an oath,HEB-6-20
41,"(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him, ``THE LORD HAS SWORN AND WILL NOT CHANGE HIS MIND, `YOU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER'"");",HEB-6-21
43,so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.,HEB-6-22
45,"The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,",HEB-6-23
47,"but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.",HEB-6-24
49,"Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.",HEB-6-25
51,"For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens;",HEB-6-26
53,"who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.",HEB-6-27
55,"For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.Copyrighted Material",HEB-6-28
1,"Now the main point in what has been said is this: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,",HEB-7-1
3,"a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man.",HEB-7-2
5,For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this high priest also have something to offer.,HEB-7-3
7,"Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law;",HEB-7-4
9,"who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, ``SEE,"" He says, ``THAT YOU MAKE all things ACCORDING TO THE PATTERN WHICH WAS SHOWN YOU ON THE MOUNTAIN.""",HEB-7-5
11,"But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.",HEB-7-6
13,"For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second.",HEB-7-7
15,"For finding fault with them, He says, ``BEHOLD, DAYS ARE COMING, SAYS THE LORD, WHEN I WILL EFFECT A NEW COVENANT WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AND WITH THE HOUSE OF JUDAH;",HEB-7-8
17,"NOT LIKE THE COVENANT WHICH I MADE WITH THEIR FATHERS ON THE DAY WHEN I TOOK THEM BY THE HAND TO LEAD THEM OUT OF THE LAND OF EGYPT; FOR THEY DID NOT CONTINUE IN MY COVENANT, AND I DID NOT CARE FOR THEM, SAYS THE LORD.",HEB-7-9
19,"``FOR THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR MINDS, AND I WILL WRITE THEM ON THEIR HEARTS. AND I WILL BE THEIR GOD, AND THEY SHALL BE MY PEOPLE.",HEB-7-10

25,"When He said, ``A new covenant, "" He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.Copyrighted Material",HEB-7-13
1,Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.,HEB-8-1
3,"For there was a tabernacle prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the sacred bread; this is called the holy place.",HEB-8-2
5,"Behind the second veil there was a tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,",HEB-8-3
7,"having a golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden jar holding the manna, and Aaron's rod which budded, and the tables of the covenant;",HEB-8-4
9,and above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; but of these things we cannot now speak in detail.,HEB-8-5
11,"Now when these things have been so prepared, the priests are continually entering the outer tabernacle performing the divine worship,",HEB-8-6
13,"but into the second, only the high priest enters once a year, not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance.",HEB-8-7
15,"The Holy Spirit is signifying this, that the way into the holy place has not yet been disclosed while the outer tabernacle is still standing,",HEB-8-8
17,"which is a symbol for the present time. Accordingly both gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot make the worshiper perfect in conscience,",HEB-8-9
19,"since they relate only to food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until a time of reformation.",HEB-8-10
21,"But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation;",HEB-8-11
23,"and not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered the holy place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.",HEB-8-12
25,"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling those who have been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh,",HEB-8-13
27,"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?",HEB-8-14
29,"For this reason He is the mediator of a new covenant, so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of the transgressions that were committed under the first covenant, those who have been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.",HEB-8-15
31,"For where a covenant is, there must of necessity be the death of the one who made it.",HEB-8-16
33,"For a covenant is valid only when men are dead, for it is never in force while the one who made it lives.",HEB-8-17
35,Therefore even the first covenant was not inaugurated without blood.,HEB-8-18
37,"For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses to all the people according to the Law, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,",HEB-8-19
39,"saying, ``THIS IS THE BLOOD OF THE COVENANT WHICH GOD COMMANDED YOU.""",HEB-8-20
41,And in the same way he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry with the blood.,HEB-8-21
43,"And according to the Law, one may almost say, all things are cleansed with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.",HEB-8-22
45,"Therefore it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.",HEB-8-23
47,"For Christ did not enter a holy place made with hands, a mere copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us;",HEB-8-24
49,"nor was it that He would offer Himself often, as the high priest enters the holy place year by year with blood that is not his own.",HEB-8-25
51,"Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world; but now once at the consummation of the ages He has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.",HEB-8-26
53,"And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment,",HEB-8-27
55,"so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for salvation without reference to sin, to those who eagerly await Him.Copyrighted Material",HEB-8-28
1,"For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near.",HEB-9-1
3,"Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins?",HEB-9-2
5,But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year.,HEB-9-3
7,For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.,HEB-9-4
9,"Therefore, when He comes into the world, He says, ``SACRIFICE AND OFFERING YOU HAVE NOT DESIRED, BUT A BODY YOU HAVE PREPARED FOR ME;",HEB-9-5
11,IN WHOLE BURNT OFFERINGS AND sacrifices FOR SIN YOU HAVE TAKEN NO PLEASURE.,HEB-9-6

17,"then He said, ``BEHOLD, I HAVE COME TO DO YOUR WILL."" He takes away the first in order to establish the second.",HEB-9-9
19,By this will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.,HEB-9-10
21,"Every priest stands daily ministering and offering time after time the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins;",HEB-9-11
23,"but He, having offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, SAT DOWN AT THE RIGHT HAND OF GOD,",HEB-9-12
25,waiting from that time onward UNTIL HIS ENEMIES BE MADE A FOOTSTOOL FOR HIS FEET.,HEB-9-13
27,For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.,HEB-9-14
29,"And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us; for after saying,",HEB-9-15
31,"``THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS UPON THEIR HEART, AND ON THEIR MIND I WILL WRITE THEM,"" He then says,",HEB-9-16

35,"Now where there is forgiveness of these things, there is no longer any offering for sin.",HEB-9-18

39,"by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us through the veil, that is, His flesh,",HEB-9-20
41,"and since we have a great priest over the house of God,",HEB-9-21
